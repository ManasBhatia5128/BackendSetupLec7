To keep track of empty folders, we make the .gitkeep file in order to store folders, since git does not keep track of empty folders
Nodemon: restarts server when file contents are changed
dev dependncy: used while development not while production, it has no role in production
to install use --save-dev or -D ie for nodemon: npm i --save-dev nodemon

controller: functionality
middleware: request from server, middleares checks the request
DB: database connection logic
models
routes: routes for app
utils: utility eg file uploading, mailing, tokens ka len-den

Team should be on same page, 4 spaces, 2 spaces for git project
for this prettier is also used as a node module, can also be installed as dev dependncy
trailing comma: all or es5
prettierignore: prettier ignore these things

In production grade settings, we never do: allow access from anywhere

Database se connect krte time problems aa sakti hain aur kaafi baar aati hain
**try, catch use kro ya fir promise ka syntax .then() .catch() wala, koi na koi krna hi padega**
**database is in another continent", baat krne mein time lgta hai, async await ka use karo

we use IIFE(immediately invoked function expression)
;IIEF: this syntax is used in case our editor didn't add semicolon is prev lines, then the IIFE function does problems in executing

to use experimental setup of dotenv 
add in dev in package.json
" -r dotenv/config --experimental-json-modules src/index.js"
syntax: dotenv.config({
    path: './env
})

middlewares are used by app.use() syntax

middleware practical example:
think you wanted to like a video on instagram, when you clicked like you couldn't because you haven't logged in
server tk like ki request gyi hi nhi, middleare ne use pehle hi rok liya
also we can add multiple middlewares
(err, req, res, next)
next is a flag which tells if middleware is used
higher order functions: functions which accept function as parameters
some examples of higher order funcns are map, filter etc or setTimeout, setInterval, basically we want to perform some operation on the function itself
basically a HOF takes a func as parameter or might return a function



Lecture-10:
BSON is used internally by MongoDB to represent documents.
Libraries like bson in Node.js provide methods to serialize and deserialize data to/from BSON.
bcrypt and bcryptjs are almost similar
bcrypt library is is used to hash passwords
JWT: JsonWebToken: encodes payload (data)

pre hook: data save hone se just pehle kuch ho jaaye, eg: password hash ho jaaye

Interview: JWT is a bearer's token, jiske pass ye token hai, data usko chale jaata hai
